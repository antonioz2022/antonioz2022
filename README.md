## 📂 Projects

Here are a few projects I’ve been working on:

- **[Coffice](https://github.com/coffice-g7/coffice)**: Coffice is a platform that connects professionals with the ideal cafés for working, studying, or simply enjoying a quiet moment. We streamline the process of discovering, filtering, and booking café spaces while you engage with an active community that provides feedback and adds value to the platform.
- **[Pet4You](https://github.com/antonioz2022/ProjetoPET4YOU)**: Pet4You is a web application designed to simplify the pet adoption process. With an intuitive design and comprehensive features, the app connects animal shelters, independent rescuers, and potential adopters, providing a centralized platform to find and adopt pets responsibly.
